# No APIs Found

No API endpoints were detected in this repository.

## What does this mean?

The code scanner looked for Express/Router route definitions but couldn't find any.

## Common reasons:

- The repository doesn't contain API endpoints
- API routes are defined in a format not yet supported by the scanner
- The route files are in a location that wasn't scanned

## Supported patterns:

The scanner looks for patterns like:
```javascript
router.get('/api/users', ...)
app.post('/api/chat', ...)
express.Router().put('/api/items/:id', ...)
```

If you believe your repository has APIs, please check the route definitions or contact support.
